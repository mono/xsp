* Compiling and installing XSP
-------------------------------

    We will assume you want to install XSP in /usr.
    
    To compile XSP from a fresh git clone (as opposed to a tarball),
    run this first:

	./autogen.sh

    To compile XSP and install it to /usr:

	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make 
	make install

    If you don't specify --prefix, it will default to /usr/local.

    If ./configure finds a working 'gmcs' it will automatically build a
    2.0 profile version of xsp, named xsp2.

* Running XSP with the bundled tests
------------------------------------

    Go to /usr/lib/xsp/test directory and run:

	mono /usr/bin/xsp.exe 

    You can optionally provide a port where the server should listen on:

	mono /usr/bin/xsp.exe --port 80

    The default port is 8080.

    There are other command line options. Run:
    
        mono /usr/bin/xsp.exe --help

    to display all of them.

Notes for MS runtime users
----------------------------
If you're compiling under windows, you may need to copy xsp.exe,
ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll and Mono.Http.dll (distributed with mono) to
xsp/server and xsp/server/test/bin directories if it's not installed for
the system.

(*) In windows, if you want to build xsp using csc, do:

    MCS=csc make

You will also need IIS with support for ASP.NET for xsp to work with the
MS runtime.
