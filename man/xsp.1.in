.SH NAME 
XSP \- Mono ASP.NET Web Server (xsp and xsp2)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xsp
[options]
.PP
or
.PP
.B mod-mono-server
[options]
.PP
or
.PP
.B fastcgi-mono-server
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
XSP, mod-mono-server and fastcgi-mono-server are hosts for ASP.NET-based applications.
.PP
If run as `xsp', the process provides a minimalistic web server which
hosts the ASP.NET runtime and can be used to test and debug web
applications that use the System.Web facilities in Mono.  This server is
most convenient for testing and running small sites, does not offer
everything a production web server offers. 
.PP
`mod-mono-server' and 'fastcgi-mono-server' are both ASP.NET runtimes hosts
that can communicate with another web server (at the time of this writing,
Apache 1.3-2.2 were supported through mod_mono and several other web
servers through FastCGI).
This mechanism is better used for high-traffic
servers or production systems, since it can integrate with the main
HTTP server and leverage all of the optimizations and extensions of an
existing server, while providing the ASP.NET runtime. You can choose
the communication channel used between mod_mono and mod-mono-server. If
you provide a --filename option, a unix socket is used, otherwise you
can give --port to use a TCP socket.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-\-address addr
Sets the IP address to listen on. By default it's 0.0.0.0 for xsp and
127.0.0.1 for mod-mono-server.
AppSettings key name: MonoServerAddress
.TP
.I \-\-port PORT
Changes the default port where the XSP server will listen to
requests.  By default XSP listens on port 8080 and mod-mono-server has
no default.
AppSettings key name: MonoServerPort
.TP
.I \-\-backlog N
The backlog of connections to set on the listener socket.
By default the value is set to 500.
.TP
.I \-\-minThreads N
The minimum number of threads the threadpool allocates. Increase this value
to better handle the sudden arrival of connections.
The default value is determined by the mono runtime.
.TP
.I \-\-filename file (mod-mono-server and fastcgi-mono-server)
The unix socket file name to listen on.
Default value: /tmp/mod_mono_server (fastcgi-mono-server: /tmp/fastcgi-mono-server)
AppSettings key name: UnixSocketFileName (fastcgi-mono-server: MonoUnixSocket)
.TP
.I \-\-root PATH
The root directory for XSP.  The default is the directory where XSP is
executed. The current directory will be changed to this one before
creating any application.
AppSettings key name: MonoServerRootDir
.TP
.I \-\-appconfigfile FILENAME
Adds application definitions from the XML configuration file. See sample
configuration file that comes with the server (sample.webapp) and
.B WEBAPP FILE FORMAT
below.
AppSettings key name: MonoApplicationsConfigFile
.TP
.I \-\-appconfigdir DIR
Adds application definitions from all XML files found in the specified
directory DIR. Files must have '.webapp' extension.
AppSettings key name: MonoApplicationsConfigDir
.TP
.I \-\-applications APPS
A comma separated list of virtual directory and real directory for all the
applications we want to manage with this server. The virtual and real dirs. are
separated by a colon. The default value is '/:.'.
.TP
Some examples:
.TP
.B '/:.'
The virtual / is mapped to the current directory.
.TP
.B '/blog:../myblog'
The virtual /blog is mapped to ../myblog
.TP
.B '/:.,/blog:../myblog'
Two applications like the above ones are handled.
.TP
.B myhost.someprovider.net:/blog:../myblog
The virtual /blog at myhost.someprovider.net is mapped to ../myblog.
.TP
.I \-\-master
.TP
This instance will be used to by mod_mono to create ASP.NET
applications on demand. If this option is provided, there is no
need to provide a list of applications to start.
This applies only to mod-mono-server.exe.
.I \-\-nonstop
By default xsp/mod-mono-server will stop processing
requests when the return key is pressed.  Use this to avoid this
behavior. 
.TP
.I \-\-no-hidden
Do not protect hidden files/directories from being accessed by clients. Hidden files/directories are those with 
Hidden attribute on Windows and whose name starts with a dot on Unix. Any file/directory below a hidden directory
is inacessible. This option turns the default behavior of protecting such locations off. If your application
does not contain any hidden files/directories, you might want to use this option as the checking process has a
per-request cost.
AppSettings key name: MonoServerCheckHiddenFiles (a boolean accepting 'true' or 'false')
.TP
.I \-\-https
Enables HTTPS support on the server, you must supply an X.509 certificate
and a private key with either the --cert/--pkfile options or with the 
--p12file (which combines both the certificate and the private key into a
single file).
.TP
To use you must first create an X.509 certificate for your server, for 
example:
.nf
	$ makecert -r -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 -n "CN=server" -p12 server.p12 s3kr3t
	Mono MakeCert - version 1.1.9.0
	X.509 Certificate Builder
	Copyright 2002, 2003 Motus Technologies. Copyright 2004-2005 Novell. BSD licensed.
	
	Success
.fi
.TP
Then you must pass the following flags to xsp:
.nf
	$ xsp --https --p12file server.p12 --pkpwd s3kr3t
.fi
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-https-client-accept
Like --https this enables HTTPS support on the server. However this option
also send an "invitation" to clients to provide client-certificates to 
authenticate themselves. Client are free to provide, or not, a client 
certificate. Web application can detect if a client certificate is used 
and react accordingly. Most web browser will not send a client certificate
unless they have been explicitly requested to do so.
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-https-client-require
Like --https this enables HTTPS support on the server. However this option
also 
.B requires 
clients to use client-certificates to authenticate themselves. Client who
do not provide client certificates will receive an error. Note that client
may send an empty certificate structure so web application should check
the certificate content.
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-p12file FILENAME
Used to specify the PKCS#12 file to use. This file includes both the X.509
certificate and the private key required to encrypt the HTTP traffic.
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-cert FILENAME
Used to specify the server X.509 certificate file. This is normally used 
with the --pkfile.
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-pkfile FILENAME
Used to specify the path to the private keyfile. The PVK format isn't 
very secure and you should use the PKCS#12 format (--p12file option) to 
store new private keys.
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-pkpwd PASSWORD
If your private key is password protected, PASSWORD is the password
used to decote the private key. This option works for both PVK and 
PKCS#12 formats.
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-protocol PROTOCOL
Specifies which protocols are available for encrypting the communications.
The possible values are Default, Tls and Ssl3.
.B Ssl2 isn't supported.
The default value is "Default" which auto-detect the client protocol and
adjust the server protocol accordingly.
.HP
This option is only valid for XSP. For mod_mono you should configure 
Apache for SSL/TLS.
.TP
.I \-\-terminate (mod-mono-server only)
Gracefully terminates a running mod-mono-server instance.  All other
options but --filename or --address and --port are ignored if this
option is provided.
.TP
.I \-\-version
Displays version information and exits.
.TP
.I \-\-help
Shows the list of options and exits.
.TP
.I \-\-verbose
Prints extra messages. Useful for debugging.
.TP
.I \-\-pidfile FILE
Writes the xsp PID to the specified file.
.SH MONO RUNTIME OPTIONS
xsp and xsp2 are scripts that call mono.  If you want to pass options
to mono (for example, options to get line numbers in stack traces),
you can use the MONO_OPTIONS environment variable when invoking xsp or
xsp2.
.PP
For example:
.nf
	$ MONO_OPTIONS=--debug xsp2
.fi
.SH DEFAULT INDEX FILES
You can choose which files are considered as index using
.I xsp.exe.config
configuration file like this:

.nf
    <appSettings>
    <add key="MonoServerDefaultIndexFiles"
         value="index.aspx" />
    </appSettings>
.fi

By default, it has index.aspx, Default.aspx, default.aspx, index.html
and index.htm. The order matters.

.SH WEBAPP FILE FORMAT
The format of the .webapp files used for --appconfigfile and
--appconfigdir is:

.nf
<apps>
<web-application>
        <name>{appname}</name>
        <vhost>{virtual host for application}</vhost>
        <vport>{port for the application}</vport>
        <vpath>{virtual directory in apache}</vpath>
        <path>{physical path to aspx files}</path>
        <!-- <enabled> is true by default -->
        <enabled>{true|false}</enabled>
</web-application>
</apps>
.fi

You can include any number of <web-application> nodes, one per
ASP.NET application to run.

There's a
.I sample.webapp
file in the XSP samples directory.
