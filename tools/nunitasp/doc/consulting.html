            <h1>Coaching</h1>

            <p>Jim Shore, the project coordinator for NUnitAsp, is an experienced software project coach.  His company, Titanium I.T., provides a range of coaching services.  All of our coaching is done in the context of your team's current project, minimizing disruptions to your schedule.  To book one of these sessions, contact <a href="mailto:jshore@titanium-it.com">Jim Shore</a>.</p>

            <h2>Free Seminars</h2>
            <p>We provide free one-hour introductions to NUnitAsp and test-driven development.  These sessions make a great brown-bag lunch for your development team, even if you're not planning on using NUnitAsp right away.  This service is available in the Portland, Oregon area.  Be sure to reserve your session well in advance.</p>

            <h2>Introductory Coaching</h2>
            <p>Our introductory coaching introduces test-driven development with NUnit and NUnitAsp to your team.  Our coach work hands-on with your team, demonstrating how NUnit and NUnitAsp fit in with their current work.  If your team is new to C# and ASP.NET, we can include mentoring in these subjects as well.  This service requires one to five days, depending on the experience of your team.</p>

            <h2>Fencepost Coaching</h2>
            <p>"Fencepost coaching" occurs periodically over a period of months.  It's a good way to gradually introduce new skills to your team.  Our coach comes in for a full day once every few weeks.  During each session, we review your team's progress, double-check our strategic direction, work hands-on with your team on a specific skill, and give a few concrete areas to improve by the next session.  Due to the short duration of each session, this service is available only in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

            <h2>Intensive Coaching</h2>
            <p>Titanium I.T. offers intensive coaching in increasing software development profitability.  This service extends beyond NUnitAsp: our coach works hands-on with your developers, management, and executives, providing expert guidance on all stages of a pilot project.  We pass on our knowledge to your leaders so that, when our engagement is complete, you will be prepared to roll out improvements across your organization.  This is an in-depth, hands-on service and it requires 60-120 days.  Contact <a href="jshore@titanium-it.com">Jim Shore</a> for more information.</p>

            <h2>Out-Sourced Tester Development</h2>
            <p>One of ASP.NET's strengths is the ability to create and sell custom controls.  If you've created a custom control, a corresponding NUnitAsp "Tester" object will make it easier for your customers to test pages that use your control.  If your team doesn't have the time or expertise to create the tester themselves, we can create it for you.  This service is provided at our site.</p>
