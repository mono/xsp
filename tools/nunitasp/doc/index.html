          <h1>Overview</h1>

          <p>NUnitAsp is a tool for automatically testing ASP.NET web pages.  It's an extension to <a href="http://www.nunit.org">NUnit</a>, a tool for test-driven development in .NET.</p>

          <p>Once you have an automated suite of tests, you'll never go back. It gives you incredible confidence in your code. That confidence allows you to code much faster, because you can make risky changes secure in the knowledge that your tests will catch any mistakes.</p>

          <p>NUnitAsp is for unit tests only. It's meant for programmers, not QA teams, and it's not very good for QA-style acceptance tests. It only tests server-side logic. JavaScript and other client-side code is ignored. But if you're using ASP.NET, it's an essential part of your programmers' toolset.</p>

          <p>NUnitAsp is freely available under the MIT license.</p>


          <h2>How It Works</h2>

          <p>NUnitAsp is a class library for use within your NUnit tests.  It provides NUnit with the ability to download, parse, and manipulate ASP.NET web pages.</p>

          <p>With NUnitASP, your tests don't need to know how ASP.NET renders controls into HTML. Instead, you can rely on the NUnitASP library to do this for you, keeping your test code simple and clean.  For example, your tests don't need to know that a DataGrid control renders as an HTML table.  You can rely on NUnitASP to handle the details.  This gives you the freedom to focus on functionality questions, like whether the DataGrid holds the expected values.</p>

          <p>Simply speaking, NUnitAsp makes it very easy to unit test ASP.NET web pages.</p>

          <p class="code">
            [Test]
            <br /><span class="keyword">public void</span> TestExample()
            <br />{
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">// First, instantiate "Tester" objects:</span>
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LabelTester label = <span class="keyword">new</span> LabelTester("textLabel", CurrentWebForm);
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LinkButtonTester link = <span class="keyword">new</span> LinkButtonTester("linkButton", CurrentWebForm);
            <br />
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">// Second, visit the page being tested:</span>
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browser.GetPage("http://localhost/example/example.aspx");
            <br />
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment">// Third, use tester objects to test the page:</span>
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AssertEquals("Not clicked.", label.Text);
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;link.Click();
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AssertEquals("Clicked once.", label.Text);
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;link.Click();
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AssertEquals("Clicked twice.", label.Text);
            <br />}
          </p>

          <p>
            NUnitAsp can test complex web sites involving multiple pages and nested controls. The common ASP.NET controls are supported (see complete list below), and support for additional controls is easy to add.
          </p>


          <h2>We Need Your Feedback!</h2>

          <p>If you <i>aren't</i> using NUnitAsp, but you want to, we want to know!  Tell us what's holding you back.  Send email to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=49940">development mailing list</a> or directly to <a href="mailto:jlittle82@users.sourceforge.net">Jim Shore</a>, the NUnitAsp project coordinator.


          <h2>Latest Release: Version 1.4</h2>

          <p>Version 1.4 includes numerous improvements, thanks to our new patch king, Levi Khatskevitch.  We have support for basic and Windows authentication, new testers, a vastly improved parser, and support for the https: protocol.  If you've tried NUnitAsp in the past and gotten stuck with a 404 error, that's fixed now!  There's numerous other small improvements.  Download it <a href="download.html">here</a>, or take a look at the <a href="changes.txt">change log</a>.

          <h2>Credits and History</h2>

          <p>NUnitAsp was created by Brian Knowles as a simple way to read and manipulate web documents with NUnit.  Jim Shore (known at the time as "Jim Little") took over the project shortly afterwards and refactored it to the Tester-based approach used for the first release.  Since then, more than a dozen people have contributed to the product.</p>

          <p>After the 1.3 release, NUnitAsp stalled for a while, lacking time and motivation from its founders.  In November 2003, Levi Khatskevitch joined the team as "patch king" and brought new energy to the project, leading to the long-anticipated release of version 1.4.</p>

          <p>NUnitAsp 1.4 was produced by Jim Shore and Levi Khatskevitch.  Jim Shore is NUnitAsp's coordinator and release king.  Levi Khatskevitch is patch king and the source of much of NUnitAsp's momentum.  Many of NUnitAsp's features are provided by our users, who are credited in the <a href="changes.txt">change log</a>.</p>

          <p>NUnitAsp is downloaded hundreds of time every month and is mentioned on web sites around the world.  It needs your support to continue to grow and improve!  If there's a tester or other feature you can contribute, code it up and send it to us.  For more information, see the <a href="contribute.html">Contributions</a> page.</p>
